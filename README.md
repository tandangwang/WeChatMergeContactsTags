# Backgroud
When you use wechat for a long time, maybe your contact tags will become too many. When you share something in your moments, choosing who to open it to can get annoying. You can select a few fixed tags to use next time, but you can't do this every time. 
Merging friends from certain tags into a new tag becomes necessary.
A small script written entirely in Python. Feel free to use it.
