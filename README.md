# Backgroud
When you use wechat for a long time, maybe your contact tags will become too many. When you share something in your moments, choosing who to open it to can get annoying. You can select a few fixed tags to use next time, but you can't do this every time. 
Merging friends from certain tags into a new tag becomes necessary.
A small script written entirely in Python. Feel free to use it.

# What the script does
copy (not move) all contacts from given tags to target tag (need to be created in advance)
1. will not delete previous tags
2. only keep one contact if duplicates exist
